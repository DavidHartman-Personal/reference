# PyCharm Reusable objects

Details on creating and using reusable objects/code/etc in PyCharm.

## Files

The Files tab contains file templates for creating new files.

## Includes
The Includes tab contains pieces of reusable content for inserting into file templates (for example, if a specific header applies to multiple file templates).

## Code
The Code tab contains internal templates for code fragments (snippets) used by PyCharm to generate various constructs. You can edit the available snippets on this tab, but you cannot create new ones.

## Live templates
To create custom code snippets, use Live templates.

## Other
The Other tab contains templates used by various application servers and frameworks. You can edit existing built-in templates on this tab, but not create new ones.
